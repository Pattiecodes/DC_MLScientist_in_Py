This dataset contains imaginary data from a ride-sharing app with user behaviors over their first month of app usage in a set of imaginary cities as well as whether they used the service 5 months after sign-up. It has been pre-loaded for you into a DataFrame called churn_data - explore it in the Shell!\n",

This is a typical setup for a churn prediction problem. To do this, you'll split the data into training and test sets, fit a small xgboost model on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the test set by computing its accuracy.\n",
